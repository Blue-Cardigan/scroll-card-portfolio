# I was Jesus again last weekend at the Codebar Fringe 2025. 

Everyone needs a hobby. 

People tell me I look like one of two popular figures:
1) Nandor from What We Do in the Shadows
2) Jesus

Both also popular halloween costumes. 

The friends I rope into writing with me think it's the brand of ironic masculinity the left needs following the failure of the US Democrats to appeal to young males demographic. 

I do it to scratch an itch.
